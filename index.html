        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Baron Tsia, and Iâ€™m a third year Statistics Major at the University of California,Riverside. I am currently interested in business marketing, sports analytics, and data science. In my free time, I love to: travel, follow baseball/basketball, work out, sneaker bot, and watch movies. Currently, Iâ€™m interning as a Marketing Research Intern. I am currently two months into my contract of six months. As a Marketing Research Intern, I manage one of my company's social media platforms. I find content that will both engage and create a discussion within our targeted audience. With this content, I am also trying to achieve a positive relationship with my clients. 
<br><br>

        Another part of my internship has to deal with the Designated Market Area within Los Angeles County. As we all know, COVID-19 has made all human interactions extremely difficult. As a company, we value human safety and health as a priority. Because of this, in person meetups is almost nonexistent within our company and community. Instead, we use virtual technology such as skype and zoom to help keep us on track. So, knowing what my company's Designated Market Area is extremely difficult. To counteract this, I had to extract data from the US census and create certain profiles that will fit within my companies values/market. Understanding what our audience will value is extremely difficult. As I mentioned, itâ€™s way easier to hear the thoughts and ideas of others while in person. Usually, I would create surveys and use statistical analysis to interpret/apply the data. But because my resources are limited, Iâ€™ve had to adapt and approach the problem with a more general application. 
	As a marketing intern, Iâ€™ve learned a lot in the professional environment. By being able to interact with people that have twenty plus years of marketing experience, Iâ€™ve learned to change the way I think as a marketing professional. For instance, itâ€™s important to understand that I have to set my personal and professional values aside. In this day in age, if you let your personal values interact with your professional career, this could be very dangerous. Iâ€™m not denying that we should get rid of our personal beliefs, but understanding what could happen if we let these two intermingle is very important. Furthermore, itâ€™s also always important to get what the client wants. At the end of the day, what matters the most in business is the money. This means that if the client pays you for something that you might find personally offensive, you have to still get the job done at the end of the day. 
<br><br>

        Lastly, I would like to talk about one of my hobbies that really helped me dive into the world of marketing. The world of sneaker reselling has really helped develop an interest in the world of marketing. This was the first time in my life when I had to put myself into two different shoes. One of which was the consumer, and the other as a seller.
